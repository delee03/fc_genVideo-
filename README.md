# Guide for running this function to generate video :
### 1. Create a bucket in S3 
In this function, I declared a bucket name "reelvideoshutech" in a variable --S3_DESTINATION_BUCKET--
After changing the bucket name, you will create a lambda function and copy this code

### 2. Create a lambda function and name it 

### 3. Configure lambda with increasing the timeout to 5 minutes 

### 4. Pass the code on it, run it if there are some errors like 

```
'BedrockRuntime' object has no attribute 'start_async_invoke'
```

You'll need to apply this troubleshoot following this blog: https://dev.to/fuderrpham03/troubleshoot-update-boto3-bedrockruntime-object-has-no-attribute-startasyncinvoke-3of7

### 5. Testing it out and see your video generated by Amazon Nova Reel on the S3 bucket
